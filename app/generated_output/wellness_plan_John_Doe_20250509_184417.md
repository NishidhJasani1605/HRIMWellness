## Daily Routine & Wellness Tips

### Wake-up and sleep timings

It's important to maintain a consistent sleep schedule to ensure you're getting adequate rest. Aim to go to bed at 11:00 PM and wake up at 6:30 AM each day, adjusting this time by 15 minutes if needed. 

### Screen time guidelines

Limit screen time to less than 8 hours per day, with no screens during meals, and at least 1 hour before bedtime. This simple change can significantly improve your sleep quality and overall well-being.

### Yoga and pranayama exercises

Considering your health concerns and goals, we recommend incorporating gentle yoga and pranayama exercises into your routine. These exercises improve flexibility, increase oxygen supply, and aid in stress management. Look for beginner-friendly yoga classes or find guided practices online. 

### Work-life balance

As a software engineer, consider setting boundaries between work and personal life. Avoid taking work home or working late nights consistently. Blocking your calendar for personal time and establishing a distinct work routine can help improve stress management and productivity.
