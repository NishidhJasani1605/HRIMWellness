#### Introduction

Hello Nishidh,

Before we delve into your personalized wellness and diet plan, I must express the importance of consulting a medical professional for conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and the advice provided in this report should not serve as a substitute for expert medical advice. My recommendations are solely intended to be a complement to proper medical treatment. 

Please be aware that if your symptoms worsen or persist, it is recommended that you consult a doctor for appropriate medical care.

Now, let's work towards your goal of gaining 63 pounds and managing your ulcerative colitis symptoms. I have tailored the following plan considering your preferences and health needs. 

#### Diet Recommendations

- Given your condition, it is important to avoid spicy and oily foods, as well as any known trigger foods that may cause discomfort. 
- Experiment with gut-friendly foods like yogurt, kefir, eggs, apples, berries, and leafy greens, incorporating more of the foods that work for you.
- Hydrate with ample water and other hydrating beverages like bone broth or herbal teas.
- If you haven't already, consider incorporating a multivitamin into your routine to ensure you get all the necessary nutrients for overall health and wellness.

#### Exercise Recommendations 

- Given your desire to increase your weight, it is crucial to avoid overexertion while exercising. Consider adding gradual daily activity, such as walking or swimming, to your routine. 
- Focus on strength training exercises targeting large muscle groups like the legs, back, and chest. These include squats, lunges, push-ups, and rows. If you have access to a gym, machines such as leg press, bench press, and row machine can be useful.
- Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise every day, gradually increasing the duration or intensity as you go. 

#### Lifestyle Modifications

- Manage stress with mindful activities such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga. Stress management is crucial for mitigating ulcerative colitis symptoms.
- Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night, as this can significantly impact your overall health and energy levels.
