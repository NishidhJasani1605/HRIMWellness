Additional Implementation Guidelines:

If any information is missing from the PDF, intelligently estimate based on individual's age, gender, location, and occupation. Use clinical reasoning to make decisions that best support holistic well-being.

Ensure all meals and ingredients strictly follow vegan compliance: No dairy, honey, eggs, or animal-derived products.

Only use Indian, state-specific and culturally accepted ingredients, grains, legumes, and recipes that are common to the region (e.g., Gujarat for someone in Surat). Avoid imported or unfamiliar items unless commonly available locally.

All plans must be realistic, sustainable, and suited to the user’s lifestyle, occupation, and household routines. Avoid overly complex meals or unrealistic routines.
