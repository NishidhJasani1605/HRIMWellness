# John, here's your customized wellness plan

This plan is tailored to your specific needs and targets, taking into account your preferences. Here's a holistic approach to help you achieve your goals and improve your overall well-being.

## Diet Recommendations

- **Avoid Dairy**: As you're lactose intolerant, it's a good idea to eliminate dairy completely. This includes milk, cheese, and yogurt. Fortunately, there are plenty of tasty lactose-free alternatives to swap in, such as almond, oat, or coconut milk, and dairy-free options for cheese and yogurt.

- **Focus on Whole Foods**: Prioritize whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. These foods provide essential nutrients and fiber, helping you feel full and supporting your overall health.

- **Increase Fiber Intake**: Aim to eat more fiber-rich foods like berries, leafy greens, legumes, and whole grains. Fiber helps with digestion, manages blood sugar levels, and can even assist in stress reduction.

- **Hydrate Well**: Ensuring adequate water intake is vital for many bodily functions. Aim to drink at least 2 liters of water daily, potentially more if you engage in strenuous activity. 

## Exercise Recommendations

- **Find an Active Hobby**: Given your sedentary occupation, it's important to prioritize physical activity. Finding a fun activity can make exercising a pleasurable habit. Consider hiking, cycling, swimming, or even dancing, ensuring it's an activity you enjoy.

- **Consistency Trumps Intensity**: Given your 2-3 times a week exercise frequency, the key is consistency. Start with regular walks, and consider bodyweight or yoga exercises you can do at home. As you progress, increase the frequency rather than intensity to establish a more robust habit.

- **Mindful Movement**: Incorporating exercises that promote core strength and flexibility can help with occasional back pain. Moreover, practicing mindfulness through exercise can contribute to stress reduction.

## Lifestyle Modifications

- **Wind Down Before Bed**: To help you reach your goal of 7-8 hours of sleep, establish a bedtime routine that prepares your mind and body for sleep. Avoid screens an hour before bed, and include activities like reading, meditation, or gentle stretching.

- **Manage Stress**: Recognize the effect that stress has on both your mental and physical health. Incorporate stress-reducing practices into your daily life, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or mindfulness techniques.

- **Set Up Reminders**: Use reminders on your phone or other devices to prompt you to drink more water, take breaks during work, or engage in physical activity.
