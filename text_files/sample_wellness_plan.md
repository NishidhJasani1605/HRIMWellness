#### Introduction

Hi John, I'm excited to work with you to develop a holistic wellness plan that will help you achieve your goals and become your best self. Let's tackle your challenges and turn them into opportunities for growth!

#### Diet Recommendations

Since you're lactose intolerant, I'll be sure to suggest foods that are dairy-free. Here's a set of guidelines that factor in your dietary preference and requirements while promoting a healthy diet:

- Choose foods that are low in fat and high in fiber to help with your weight loss goals. Focus on wholegrains, fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.

- Consume foods that are high in potassium and calcium, such as dark leafy greens (kale, broccoli), fish (salmon), and nuts (almonds) to maintain healthy bones given your occasional back pain history.

- To help you manage stress, consume whole foods that are high in vitamins C and B, such as berries, avocado, and lentils. These help with cortisol regulation and support calm energy.

#### Exercise Recommendations

Given your current activity level and the fact that you experience high stress levels, I don't want to overwhelm you with a rigorous exercise plan. 

I suggest the following:

- Focus on consistent, regular exercise rather than intense, short sessions. A 30-minute brisk walk every day can do wonders for your physical and mental health. This can be supplemented by some strength training using free weights or your body weight, which helps build muscle and increases metabolism.

- If possible, add a daily stretching routine to your daily rituals. This can help reduce stress and alleviate back pain. 

- Try to fit in exercises that help you exert energy and provide mental health benefits, such as jogging, cycling, or yoga. The goal is to find an enjoyable form of exercise that you can stick to consistently.

#### Lifestyle Recommendations

These suggestions are aimed at promoting overall wellness and tackling your specific concerns:

- To mitigate high stress levels, incorporate activities and practices into your routine that foster relaxation and mindfulness. This could be meditation, journaling, or spending time in nature. 

- Ensure you're getting sufficient high-quality sleep of 7-9 hours each night. To achieve this, maintain a consistent sleep and wake-up time, create a pre-sleep routine, and optimize your bedroom for comfort and tranquility.

- To help with your weight loss goal, increase your water intake to approximately 3 liters per day. This will help you feel full, enhance your physical performance, and support your body's detoxification processes.

#### 3-Day Sample Meal Plan

Here is a collection of meal ideas to give you a starting point. You can tailor it to your preferences and adjust portion sizes to your needs. 

Each meal should contain a good balance of protein, slow-release carbs, and vegetables:

**Day 1**
- Breakfast: Scrambled eggs with spinach and tomatoes, wholegrain toast, and fruit salad
- Lunch: Grilled chicken salad with walnuts, cranberries, and a citrus vinaigrette
- Dinner: Baked salmon with roasted broccoli and quinoa pilaf

**Day 2**
- Breakfast: Smoothie made with banana, spinach, protein powder, and almond milk
- Lunch: Veggie quesadillas (fillings: beans, corn, peppers, onions) with a side salad
- Dinner: Grilled pork tenderloin with roasted potatoes and steamed green beans 

**Day 3**
- Breakfast: Overnight oats with nuts, berries, and chia seeds
- Lunch: Grilled shrimp salad with arugula, avocado, and lemon dressing
- Dinner: Lentil stew with spinach and tomatoes, cooked in chicken stock

#### Weekly Exercise Schedule

Every week, you should aim to exercise at least twice a week, ideally spreading it out across varied activities to work out your whole body. Here's a template to follow, but feel free to adjust according to your preferences:

**Monday:** 
- 30 minutes of brisk walking
- 10-15 minutes of stretching (before and after a walk)

**Tuesday** 
 - Yoga or Pilates (could be a video at home or a class)
- 10-15 minutes of stretching afterwards

**Wednesday**
- Rest or active recovery (walk)

**Thursday** 
- Jogging or cycling (for 20-30 minutes)
- Stretching afterwards

**Friday**
- 30 minutes of brisk walking

**Saturday**

**Sunday:**

Remember, the key to success is to make healthy eating and exercise a fun and enjoyable part of your life.
