## Usage

### Automated Workflow
To process new form submissions and generate plans:
```bash
python automate_workflow.py
```

### WhatsApp Chatbot
To start the WhatsApp chatbot server:
```bash
python whatsapp_chatbot.py
```

You'll need to expose your webhook server to the internet using a service like ngrok:
```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

Then set the Twilio WhatsApp webhook to the provided ngrok URL + `/whatsapp`.

### WhatsApp Chatbot Features
The WhatsApp chatbot supports these commands:
- **Start/Hello/Hi** - Display the welcome menu
- **1 or "status"** - Check wellness plan status
- **2 or "request"** - Request a new wellness plan (sends form link)
- **3 or "contact"** - Get contact information for a dietician
- **4 or "FAQ"** - View frequently asked questions
- **help** - Display help menu

### Unexpected Questions Handling
When users ask questions not covered by the predefined commands:
1. The question is automatically forwarded to the owner's WhatsApp
2. The owner receives a notification with the user's question and contact details
3. The owner can respond directly to the customer using the format:
   ```
   Reply to:
   <customer_number>
   <your response message>
   ```
4. The system will send the owner's response back to the customer

## Security & Best Practices
- **Never commit your `.env` or `credentials.json` files.**
- Review all generated plans for accuracy before sharing with users.
- Ensure compliance with privacy and data protection regulations.
- Regularly monitor logs and unexpected questions to improve the system.
- Set up rate limiting to prevent abuse of the OpenAI API.

## Google Apps Script Integration
- Use the provided `apps_script_email.js` as a template for your Google Apps Script
- Deploy as a web app with access set to "Anyone, even anonymous"
- Set the deployed URL in the `.env` file as `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_WEBHOOK`
